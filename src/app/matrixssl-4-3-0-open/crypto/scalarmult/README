This directory implements X25519 key agreement primitives for SafeZone CL/SL. The implementation consists of software from
libsodium 1.0.16.

The software has been modified to use psSodium and SLCrypto prefixes
for functions to ensure it does not use the same function names than
libsodium (and therefore potentially conflict with libsodium).

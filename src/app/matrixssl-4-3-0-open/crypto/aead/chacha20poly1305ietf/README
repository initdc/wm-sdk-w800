This directory implements chacha20-poly1305 autenticated encryption
function for MatrixSSL. The implementation consists of software from
libsodium 1.0.12.

The software has been modified to use psSodium and psCrypto prefixes
for functions to ensure it does not use the same function names than
libsodium (and therefore potentially conflict with libsodium).

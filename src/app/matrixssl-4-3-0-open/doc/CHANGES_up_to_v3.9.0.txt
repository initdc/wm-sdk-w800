1. BUG FIXES SINCE 3.8.7B


Fixed server-side handling of client authentication with Server Name Indication

This bug caused client authentication to fail when MatrixSSL was used as
the server and the client was sending the Server Name Indication
extension.


Constant Time Modular Exponentiation

It was reported by Andreas Zankl that Matrix Crypto implementation had a
side-channel information leak via instruction cache. In response to the
research, Matrix Crypto modular exponentiation was changed to use code
that does not leak information via instruction cache and uses
constant-time execution. The new code is slower. (Note: The SafeZone
CL/CLS cryptography used in MatrixSSL FIPS Edition has been using
constant time modular exponention before.)



2. NEW FEATURES SINCE 3.8.7B


RFC 5280 Compliant Certificate Matching

Matching certificate fields in MatrixSSL has been improved. MatrixSSL
now implements the requirement from RFC 5280 that Subject Alternative
Name is used for matching instead of subject Common Name if alternative
name is available. Subject Alternative Name contain more precise
information on the type of the field and thus avoids false positive
field matches. MatrixSSL now allows RFC 5280 compliant matching of email
addresses, where only domain name part is case insensitive. It is now
possible to specify the type of name to match with new session options.
See the Session Options section in the MatrixSSL APIs manual for
details.

The issues in certificate matching were reported by a team of
researchers from Columbia University, consisting of Suphannee Sivakorn,
George Argyros, Kexin Pei, Suman Jana and Angelos D. Keromytis.


Certificate Validation Configuration Options

New session options have been added for configuring MatrixSSL's internal
certificate validation process. These include options for specifying the
field in the server certificate against which the expected server name
should be matched, an option to limit the maximum certificate chain
validation depth and options for retaining the peer certificate after
processing. See the Session Options section in the MatrixSSL APIs manual
for details.


Client Authentication using an External Security Token

MatrixSSL's external client authentication feature allows client-side
private key operation in TLS client authentication, i.e. the signing of
the handshake_messages hash in the CertificateVerify handshake message,
to be offloaded from MatrixSSL to an external module such as a security
or authentication token. See the MatrixSSL External Module Integration
manual for details.


X.509 Generation Improvements (Commercial Edition Only)

Support has been added for encoding the netscape-comment certificate
extension. The psParseCertReqBufExt API has been added. This version of
psParseCertReqBufExt allows storing additional information from the
parsed CSR. Another additional API is psX509SetPublicKey, which can be
used to set the public key in a psCertConfig_t struct, before it is
passed to the CSR or certificate encoding routines. See the MatrixSSL
Certificates and Certificate Revocation Lists manual for details.


Added psX509GetOnelineDN API

The new psX509GetOnelineDN API can be used to generate a one-line string
representation of a Distinguished Name.


Added matrixValidateCertsExt API

The new matrixValidateCertsExt API has an additional options struct
argument for configuring some aspects of the certificate chain
validation process. The old matrixValidateCerts API is now deprecated.


Support for RSA-MD2 and RSA-MD5 Signatures in CSR and CRL Parsing

Support for RSA-MD2 and RSA-MD5 signature verification has been added to
CSR parsing, and support for RSA-MD2 signature verification has been
added to CRL parsing. These insecure, legacy algorithms are disabled by
default, but they can be enabled by defining USE_MD2 or USE_MD5.


ALLOW_CRL_ISSUERS_WITHOUT_KEYUSAGE Compatibility Option

The ALLOW_CRL_ISSUERS_WITHOUT_KEYUSAGE build-time option allows CRL
authentication to succeed even when signer CA's cert does not have the
keyUsage extension and thus no cRLSign bit. This option is for
compatibility with old CRL issuer certs. RFC 5280 requires CRL issuer
certs to have the keyUsage extension and the cRLSign bit.



3. OTHER CHANGES SINCE 3.8.7B


Indent style changes

Indent style has been changed and made more consistent accross source
and header files.


Changes in 3.8.7b

  VERSION 3.8.7B January 2017 (C) Copyright 2017 INSIDE Secure - All
  Rights Reserved

1.  BUG FIXES SINCE 3.8.7

-   Fixed compile error if SHA224 was enabled.
-   Fixed compile warning around HTTP2 alpn detection.

1. BUG FIXES SINCE 3.8.7


Fixed issue where a cipher suite could be negotiated that did not match the authentication type for the keys.

This manifested in the default apps/ssl/server.c example when Chrome was
connected. It negotiated an ECDSA based cipher even though keys loaded
by default were RSA keys.

-   New Configuration: Minimal PSK



1. BUG FIXES SINCE 3.8.6


Fixed Wrong Computation Results Bug In pstm.c Division

The bug could cause some big number mathematics to return wrong values
when divisor and dividend are very far from each other. This issue is
related to public key computation problems reported by Security
Researcher Hanno Böck.


Fixed Memory Corruption In psDhImportPubKey

Importing Diffie-Hellman public key cleared some memory beyond end of
the key. On some systems this bug may have caused memory corruption.


Fixed RSA Public Key Read Overflow

When importing RSA key from certificate, maliciously crafted RSA public
key could cause read buffer overflow and crash.


X.509/CRL/OCSP Timestamp Validation

MatrixSSL accepted some X.509 certificates with illegal timestamps, such
as leap day in an ordinary year. In additional, some two digit years
were parsed incorrectly. Timestamp parsing has been altered everywhere
to use new psBrokenDownDate API, which correctly handles these corner
cases. Some of X.509 time parsing issues were reported by Sze Yiu Chau.


Unix Year 2038 Problem Fix

On 32-bit Unix devices, time_t type, which is signed will overflow in
2038. A workaround was added that will allow timestamps and dates to be
processed correctly by MatrixSSL on and after Tuesday 19 January 2038.


Stricter OID Comparison

The OID comparison in MatrixSSL uses a simple non-cryptographic digest
function, based on sum of bytes, which is not collision free. Comparison
of OID binary representation was added to ensure unknown OIDs are not
accidentally interpreted the same than some of existing OIDs. This issue
was reported by Sze Yiu Chau.


Multibyte String Handling

The MatrixSSL now includes function to recode strings containing
multibyte (BMPString) characters as UTF-8 strings. This handling is
applied to X.509 certificate fields, such as Subject Name. This allows
code using MatrixSSL to work with BMPString input without actually
knowing the encoding used.


Configuration Robustness Improvements

MatrixSSL has been made more robust with configurations: changing
configuration options is less likely to cause problems building the
software.

These improvements allow smaller configurations for embedded systems.
(E.g. build without DTLS, or build only server-side or client-side
support.)


X.509 Certificate Parsing Read Overflow

Fixed read overflow from X.509 certificate date handling and removed
possible buffer read overflow in parseGeneralNames(). Without these
fixes maliciously crafted X.509 certificate could cause software crash.


PKCS #8 Buffer Read Overflow

Fixed reading overly large invalid PKCS #8 encoded private key. Without
this fix, maliciously crafted PKCS #8 file could cause software crash.


OCSP Bug Fixes

In lieu of OCSP improvements, small bugs in OCSP implementation have
been fixed. The most notable bug was a memory leak.


Generic Bug Fixes For Test Programs

Removed some warnings and memory leaks from test programs. Made test
programs confirm to Unix/POSIX return value scheme on relevant
platforms.


Changes to Recommended Configurations

The recommended configurations have been edited slightly. Most notably,
the tracing is disabled by default on non-debug configurations.


psMutex Locking and Unlocking APIs Compiler Warnings Removed

Removed return value from psLockMutex() and psUnlockMutex() APIs. This
removes several warnings regarding return values not being used.


MD5 and SHA-1 Combined Digest Function

The MatrixSSL will now invoke combined MD5 and SHA-1 hash function
psMd5Sha1, whenever possible instead of separate MD5 and SHA-1 hash
functions.


Coverity Issues Fixed

Implementation of getTicketKeys and parseSSLHandshake functions was
changed to remove issues detected by Coverity.


Yarrow Build Issues Fixed

MatrixSSL comes with a version of Yarrow PRNG. Its use has been
deprecated, but the PRNG continued to be shipped with MatrixSSL.
Unfortunately, the latest versions of MatrixSSL had compilation errors
in yarrow.c. Those errors have been fixed, and the source code file has
been marked deprecated.



2. NEW FEATURES SINCE 3.8.6


SHA-512 for X.509 Certificates Improvements

MatrixSSL can use SHA-512 to sign self-signed certificate or certificate
request. SHA-512 was already previously supported for verification of
X.509 certificates. (This feature can be used only on MatrixSSL
Commercial Edition.)


OCSP Improvements

OCSP example application apps/crypto/ocsp.c (Commercial Edition Only)
and MatrixSSL Developer Guide have been improved to give more
documentation regarding OCSP request. OCSP request can now use
requestorId feature and request status of list of certificates.


X.509 Certificate Domain Components

Added Functions for obtaining contents of X.509 certificate Domain
Component field(s).


New Configuration: Minimal PSK

New configuration psk added. This configuration provides small footprint
MatrixSSL build with only Pre-Shared Key and TLS 1.2 functionality using
Matrix Crypto.


Changes in 3.8.6

  VERSION 3.8.6 October 2016 (C) Copyright 2016 INSIDE Secure - All
  Rights Reserved

1.  BUG FIXES

-   Critical parsing bug for X.509 certificates
-   Critical TLS handshake parsing bugs

2.  FEATURES AND IMPROVEMENTS

-   New configuration system for build options
-   core/ changes
-   X.509 parsing and generation

1 BUG FIXES


Critical parsing bug for X.509 certificates

Security Researcher Craig Young reported two issues related to X.509
certificate parsing. An error in parsing a maliciously formatted Subject
Alt Name field in a certificate could cause a crash due to a write
beyond buffer and subsequent free of an unallocated block of memory. An
error in parsing a maliciously formatted ASN.1 Bit Field primitive could
cause a crash due to a memory read beyond allocated memory.


Critical TLS handshake parsing bugs

Security Researcher Andreas Walz reported three issues related to
processing the ClientHello message.

-   The length of the TLS record was not being strictly checked against
    the length of the extensions field, so that additional unparsed data
    could be added between the end of extensions and the end of
    the record. This presents some level of uncertainty in how
    extensions may be interpreted and could present a security issue.
-   ClientHello parsing was not verifying that a NULL compression suite
    was sent by the client, as required by the RFC. This did not present
    a security issue (NULL compression was always forced), but improves
    strict adherence to the specification.
-   For TLS connections (not DTLS), the major version proposed in the
    ClientHello suggested by RFC 5246 to only allow the byte value 0x03.
    Now the connection is terminated if a value other than this
    is suggested. Previously the suggested major version field was
    simply echoed back in the ServerHello message, and treated as 0x03.


4096 bit RSA key generation regression

In some cases RSA key generation of 4096 bit keys would fail and return
with an error code. This regression issue has been fixed and key
generation will once again succeed.


General cleanup of build

Warnings across multiple platforms and compilers were fixed. Various
compile time configuration combination build issues were fixed.


MatrixSSH compatibility issue

Newer versions of MatrixSSH server were incompatible with the PuTTY
client. A fix has been included and enabled by default
USE_PUTTY_WORKAROUND. _Note this does not affect the standard MatrixSSL
codebase_.



2 FEATURES AND IMPROVEMENTS


New configuration system for build options

A new top level directory configs/ now holds several sets of
configuration files for MatrixSSL to simplify configuration sets. This
method also allows custom sets to be developed specific to a given use
case (for example a RSA only build). The following three configuration
files now are copied at build time from the configs directory:

    core/coreConfig.h
    crypto/cryptoConfig.h
    matrixssl/matrixsslConfig.h

  THE DEFAULT CONFIGURATION SETTINGS FOR MATRIXSSL MAY HAVE CHANGED FROM
  YOUR CURRENT SETTINGS. PLEASE CONFIRM ALL SETTINGS IN THESE THREE
  FILES AFTER UPDATING.

From a fresh package, the build process is the same as before: simply
type make. It will build the software using the default configuration
options.

To use a different configuration, for example configs/noecc:

    $ make clean && make all-noecc

Once a configuration is set, make and make clean will continue to use
the same configuration unless a new one is selected as above.


core/ changes

-   Added warning helper macros
-   Additional PS_ return codes
-   Buffer helper APIs in psbuf.h
-   Foundation for PS_NETWORKING support for sockets level API
-   psMutex_t API return code change, now returns void and will call
    abort() on POSIX platforms.
-   test/ new self-test directory
-   Change in default Linux compile options in common.mk


X.509 parsing and generation

Added additional field parsing support for X.509, including multiple OU
support. Commercial release adds additional certificate creation
support, as well as an API set and test suite for programmatically
creating certificates. See _MatrixKeyAndCertGeneration.pdf_ for full
description.


crypto/ changes

-   Added *PreInit() APIs for hash functions for compatibility with FIPS
    library and hardware token requirements
-   Added psX509GetCertPublicKeyDer() API
-   Support dsa_sig OID for certificates`
-   Support for ASN_VISIBLE_STRING
-   Moved CRL functionality into keyformat/crl.c
-   Support for parsing an implicitly encoded ECC key without a DER
    header, as sometimes encountered in the wild.
-   Added PKCS#8 import
-   ALLOW_VERSION_1_ROOT_CERT_PARSE configuration option for loading
    legacy v1 certificates as trusted roots only (default not enabled).
    Loading as intermediate or leaf certificates is insecure and still
    not allowed.


Removed OpenSSL API Emulation

-   opensslApi.c and opensslSocket.c files removed temporarily in
    anticipation of moving to a more fully supported OpenSSL layer.


Changes in 3.8.5

  VERSION 3.8.5 September 2016 _Note: 3.8.5 was a limited customer
  release only._


Changes in 3.8.4

  VERSION 3.8.4 July 2016 (C) Copyright 2016 INSIDE Secure - All Rights
  Reserved

1.  FEATURES AND IMPROVEMENTS

-   Coverity coverage
-   HTTP/2 restrictions via ALPN
-   Enhanced example apps
-   Process shared Session Cache
-   Enhanced CRL and OCSP support
-   Windows support for certificate date validation

2.  BUG FIXES

-   Critical parsing bug for RSA encrypted blobs
-   Additional restrictions on bignum operations
-   Fixed error in disabled cipher flags
-   Fixed error in DTLS encoding
-   SSLv3 only support fixed
-   Assembly compatibility with more compilers



1 FEATURES AND IMPROVEMENTS


Coverity coverage

MatrixSSL now has zero outstanding defects in Coverity Static Analysis.


HTTP/2 restrictions via ALPN

MatrixSSL server code will automatically evaluate the ALPN extension and
appropriately restrict the cipher suites and key exchange methods if the
HTTP/2 protocol is being used. Per the HTTP/2 spec, only AEAD cipher
suites and Ephemeral key exchange methods are allowed.


Enhanced example apps

Example applications now take additional command line options and also
support CRL request and response generation.


Process shared Session Cache

Minimal support for a process-shared server session resumption cache is
now supported via process-shared mutexes on Linux.


Enhanced CRL and OCSP support

A new file _crypto/keyformat/crl.c_ defines additional apis for more
complex CRL (Certificate Revocation List) and OCSP support.


Windows support for certificate date validation

Previously only Posix based platforms were supported.



2 BUG FIXES


Critical parsing bug for RSA encrypted blobs

Security Researcher Hanno Böck reported several issues related to RSA
and bignum operations. An error in parsing a maliciously formatted
public key block could produce a remotely triggered crash in SSL server
parsing. Additional restrictions on the values provided to RSA and DH
operations were also added, although an exploit has not been found.


Additional restrictions on bignum operations

The MatrixSSL bignum library, located in _crypto/math/_ was optimized
and reduced in size to support only key sizes and operations used by
standard RSA, ECC and DH operations (those apis present in
_crypto/cryptoApi.h_). Additional constraint checking has been added to
the code to prevent unsupported key sizes and values. Users requiring
generic bignum operations should take a look at libtomcrypt, GMP, Python
or OpenSSL.


Fixed error in disabled cipher flags

The optional disabling or enabling of specific ciphers at runtime per
session was recently broken (now fixed) due to an errant flags
calculation using < instead of <<.


Fixed error in DTLS encoding

An error was returned if attempting to encode a DTLS message exactly the
PMTU size.


SSLv3 only support fixed

SSLv3 mode is not recommended for deployment, but had become broken in a
recent build. It can now be enabled again.


Assembly compatibility with more compilers

Fixed "invalid register constraints" error on some versions of GCC and
LLVM for ARM, MIPS and x86_64.


Changes in 3.8.3

  VERSION 3.8.3 April 2016 (C) Copyright 2016 INSIDE Secure - All Rights
  Reserved

-   Libsodium Crypto Provider
-   Extended Master Secret
-   Online Certificate Status Protocol
-   TLS Fallback SCSV
-   Trusted CA Indication Extension
-   Removed gmt_unix_time from client and server random
-   Removed support for SSLv2 CLIENT_HELLO messages

    message
-   Improvements to DTLS Cookie handling
-   Fixed key type verification for chosen cipher suite
-   Validation of RSA Signature Creation
-   Side Channel Vulnerability on RSA Cipher Suites
-   Access Violation on Malicious TLS Record



1 FEATURES AND IMPROVEMENTS


Simplified Configuration Options

The configuration files _coreConfig.h_, _cryptoConfig.h_ and
_matrixsslConfig.h_ have been simplified, and the default options have
been changed to improve security and code size.

-   Many of the insecure algorithms or deprecated options that can be
    enabled in _cryptoConfig.h_ and _matrixsslConfig.h_ have been moved
    into _cryptolib.h_ and _matrixssllib.h_, respectively.
-   TLS 1.1 is now the default minimum TLS version compiled in. The new
    USE_TLS_1_1_AND_ABOVE setting enables this.
-   Rehandshaking on an existing connection is now disabled completely
    by default with the USE_REHANDSHAKING configuration option.


DTLS Combined Package

DTLS is now packaged with MatrixSSL, and can be enabled with the
USE_DTLS configuration option. TLS and DTLS connections can be made
simultaneously with the same application.


CHACHA20_POLY1305 Cipher Suites

MatrixSSL now has support for ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher suites compatible
with RFC draft
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-chacha20-poly1305. The
supported cipher suites are defined for TLS 1.2 and can be enabled at
compile time.

_cryptoConfig.h_
    USE_CHACHA20_POLY1305_IETF

_matrixsslConfig.h_
    TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
    TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256

MatrixSSL must be linked with the libsodium library to provide
implementation of the crypto primitives.


Libsodium Crypto Provider

MatrixSSL now includes a layer for crypto primitives to the _libsodium_
crypto library, in addition to the _OpenSSL libcrypto_ and the native
(default) MatrixSSL crypto library. _libsodium_ provides crypto
primitives for ChaCha20 and Poly1305. In addition, enabling the layer
will use _libsodium_ primitives for SHA256/SHA384/SHA512 based hashes
and AES-256-GCM ciphers that provide high performance on _Intel_
platforms.

  As of this release, the current version of libsodium is available
  here:
  https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/libsodium-1.0.8.tar.gz
  To build libsodium, follow the instructions here:
  https://download.libsodium.org/doc/installation/index.html

To enable in the MatrixSSL make system, enable the following and
rebuild:

_common.mk_
    PS_LIBSODIUM:=1 LIBSODIUM_ROOT:=_(path_to_libsodium_build)_


Extended Master Secret

The “extended master secret” as specified in RFC 7627 is an important
security feature for TLS implementations that use session resumption.
The extended master secret feature associates the internal TLS master
secret directly to the connection context to prevent man-in-the-middle
attacks during session resumption. One such attack is a synchronizing
triple handshake as described in Triple Handshakes and Cookie Cutters:
Breaking and Fixing Authentication over TLS.

See the _Extended Master Secret_ section in the _MatrixSSL API_ document
for details.


Online Certificate Status Protocol

The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is an alternative to the
Certificate Revocation List (CRL) mechanism for performing certificate
revocation tests on server keys. TLS integrates with OCSP in a mechanism
known as “OCSP stapling”. This feature allows the client to request that
the server provide a time-stamped OCSP response when presenting the
X.509 certificate during the TLS handshake. The primary goal for this
scheme is to allow resource constrained clients to perform certificate
revocation tests without having to communicate with an OCSP Responder
themselves.

See the _OCSP Revocation_ section in the _MatrixSSL API_ document for
details.


TLS Fallback SCSV

The RFC for detecting version rollback attacks has been implemented per
RFC7507. See the _MatrixSSL Developer’s Guide_ for more information.


Trusted CA Indication Extension

The Trusted CA Indication extension is specified in RFC 6066. This
feature allows TLS clients to send their list of certificate authorities
to servers in the CLIENT_HELLO message.
See the Trusted CA Indication section in the _MatrixSSL_API_ document
for details.


Removed gmt_unix_time from client and server random

The TLS RFC specifies that the first 4 bytes of the CLIENT_HELLO and
SERVER_HELLO random values be the current platform time. Current best
practices recommend using random data for all 32 bytes. MatrixSSL now
uses all random data by default.


Removed support for SSLv2 CLIENT_HELLO messages

SSLv2 CLIENT_HELLO parsing was previously supported to maintain
compatibility with very old TLS implementations. Although this does not
present a security risk at this time, the code has been removed, and
only modern TLS record header parsing is supported.


Ephemeral ECC Key Caching

Previous versions of MatrixSSL generated new, unique ephemeral keys for
each connection using ECDHE_ cipher suites, as per NIST recommendations.
Beginning with this version, ephemeral keys are cached and re-used for
connections within a time frame of two hours and a maximum usage of 1000
times. This improves performance of ECDHE suites, and is inline with the
configuration current web browsers. This feature can be configured in
_matrixsslConfig.h_.



2 BUG FIXES


Support for parsing large certificate blobs

Certificate collections larger than 64KB were not being parsed correctly
after a change to some data types (32 bit to 16 bit) in the parsing
code. This bug is now fixed and large collections of certificates are
now parsing correctly.


X.509 certificate parse fix for issuerUniqueID and subjectUniqueID

Previous MatrixSSL versions could not parse these rarely encountered
members of X.509 certificates.


Diffie-Hellman public key exchange bug

MatrixSSL clients would not successfully handshake with servers that
sent Diffie-Hellman public keys that were not the same byte length as
the DH group Prime parameter. Clients will now successfully handshake
with servers that provide shorter length public keys.


SHA512 based Server Key Exchange signatures

SHA512 was not supported for SERVER_KEY_EXCHANGE messages in previous
versions.


Allow independent hashSigAlg identifiers in Certificate Request message

Previous client versions of MatrixSSL would not allow servers to send
signature algorithm identifiers that were not already specified by the
client in the CLIENT_HELLO message. Now, the client will correctly allow
the server to send an independent list of supported algorithms and the
client will look for matches from that list.


Improvements to DTLS Cookie handling

HMAC-SHA1 or HMAC-SHA256 are now used to generate the DTLS cookie, and
additional checking is done on the cookie for Denial-of-Service
prevention.


Fixed key type verification for chosen cipher suite

An internal verification function that determined whether the server key
type was correct for the chosen cipher suite has now been fixed.
Previous versions would sometimes incorrectly determine the server was
using the wrong key type if the server was using a certificate chain
where parent certificates did not use the same key type. This bug
resulted in a failed handshake and is now fixed.


Validation of RSA Signature Creation

An internal RSA validation of created signatures has been added to the
library in the psRsaEncryptPriv() function.

Security researcher Florian Weimer has shown it is possible for RSA
private key information to leak under some special failure
circumstances. Information on the exploit can be found here:
https://people.redhat.com/~fweimer/rsa-crt-leaks.pdf

The potential leak is only possible if a DHE_RSA based cipher suite is
supported on the server side. This is the only handshake combination in
which an RSA signature is sent over the wire (during the
SERVER_KEY_EXCHANGE message). The signature itself must have been
incorrectly generated for the exploit to be possible.

The additional signature validation test will now cause the TLS
handshake to fail prior to a faulty signature being sent to the client.


Side Channel Vulnerability on RSA Cipher Suites

A Bleichenbacher variant attack, where certain information is leaked
from the results of a RSA private key operation has been reported by a
security researcher. The code has been updated to error without
providing any information on the premaster contents. Thank you to Juraj
Somorovsky, author of TLS-Attacker > Note that other side channel
attacks may still be possible as MatrixSSL non-FIPS crypto is not always
constant-time.


Access Violation on Malicious TLS Record

TLS cipher suites with CBC mode in TLS 1.1 and 1.2 could have an access
violation (read beyond memory) with a maliciously crafted message. Thank
you to Juraj Somorovsky, author of TLS-Attacker



3 KNOWN ISSUES


-   _Microsoft Windows_ targets do not support certificate date
    validation currently. Users requiring this feature can use Windows
    APIs to get and parse the current date, using the POSIX
    implementation as a reference.
-   _Arm_ platforms linking with some versions of _OpenSSL_ libcrypto
    library may have errors in AES-CBC cipher suites due to the
    library's inability to handle in-situ encryption within the
    same block.

1 FILE/API REORGANIZATION


File Locations

MatrixSSL 3.8.2 introduces directory changes to the distribution since
3.7.2

TLS/DTLS example apps moved from ./apps to ./apps/ssl and ./apps/dtls.
Test keys and certificates moved from ./sampleCerts to ./testkeys. XCode
and Visual Studio projects moved to ./xcode and ./visualstudio.

Several file changes and renames are present as well:

TLS Decoding moved ./matrixssl/sslDecode.c from ./matrixssl/sslDecode.c,
./matrixssl/hsDecode.c and ./matrixssl/extDecode.c. Private key
import/export from ./crypto/pubkey/pkcs.c. to ./crypto/keyformat/pkcs.c.
Configuration consistency and sanity checks from
./matrixssl/matrixssllib.h to ./matrixssl/matrixsslCheck.h.


Crypto API

The API layers into the raw cryptographic operations have been
significantly changed. The crypto API changes do not affect the main
MatrixSSL API for creating TLS sessions, etc. However, developers who
interface with crypto directly, or who want to write a custom hardware
layer will be interested in the new layer.

API Model

The cryptography API for symmetric crypto, digests and HMAC follow the
common model:

INIT API
    Initializes the cipher and returns an error on failure (typically
    due to bad input parameters or insufficient memory).

ENCRYPT/DECRYPT/UPDATE API
    Performs the operation and does not return an error code (previously
    some APIs would return the number of bytes decrypted).

CLEAR API
    Zero and/or free any associated memory associated with the cipher.

Standard Types

Standard C99 types from <stdint.h> are used to specify integer
parameters.

uint8_t
    The length of an IV, password or an AES-GCM tag

uint16_t
    The length of an asymmetric key (RSA/DH/ECC), a HMAC key or
    Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) for an AEAD cipher such
    as AES-GCM.

uint32_t
    The length of data to be processed by the cipher

uint64_t: Internally used by crypto library to store large counter
values and when optimizing for 64 bit platforms.

Const Correctness

Pointers to values that are not modified are marked const.

API Name changes

API names have been standardized as follows:

Initialization of low level AES block cipher from psAesInitKey to
psAesInitBlockKey. AES CBC from psAesInit, psAesDecrypt and psAesEncrypt
to psAesInitCBC, psAesDecryptCBC and psAesEncryptCBC. SHA2 HMAC from
psHmacSha2 to psHmacSha256 and psHmacSha384. ECC signature creation from
psEccSignHash to psEccDsaSign. ECC signature validation from
psEcDsaValidateSignature to psEccDsaVerify.

Standardized Context Names

Cryptographic functions that used to accept generic “context”
identifiers now require the specific key/algorithm structure, for
example:

HMAC family from psHmacContext_t to psHmacSha1_t, psHmacSha256_t, ...
Digest family from psDigestContext_t to psSha1_t, psSha256_t, etc...
Symmetric family from psCipherContext_t to psAesCbc_t, psAesGcm_t,
psDes3Key_t RSA private key parse (pkcs1) from psPubKey_t to psRsaKey_t.
ECC private key parse from psPubKey_t to psEccKey_t.

Standardized Return Types

In general, Init apis return a standard PS_* status code. A status code
that is not PS_SUCCESS typically indicates invalid input parameters or a
resource allocation failure. Update and Clear APIs no longer have a
return. For example:

HMAC Init from void to int32_t. HMAC Final from int32_t to void. Digest
Init from void to int32_t. Digest Final from int32_t to void.

Memory Model

In general, APIs now take an allocated cipher structure, and do not
allocate the structure in the Init routine. In the past, the memory
allocation model was inconsistent.

For ECC and DH, there are now additional APIs that allow the key to be
allocated and initialized, to complement the APIs which just initialize
the keys.

The Clear API must always be called when done with a context, as some
algorithms internally allocate additional memory for operation.



2 SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS


Simplified Configuration

The configuration of ciphers and cipher suites in
_crypto/cryptoConfig.h_ and _matrixssl/matrixsslConfig.h_ has been
simplified considerably. Existing and new users of MatrixSSL should take
a look at these files to understand the various options and features
supported.


Deprecated Ciphers

-   ARC4, SEED, IDEA, RC2, MD4 and MD2 are deprecated, and not enabled
    by default in _cryptoConfig.h_
-   MD5 and SHA1 are not recommended for use, but enabled by default
    because they are required for TLS protocols before version 1.2.
    Although they are enabled in _cryptoConfig.h,_ their use within the
    TLS protocol is limited to where required, and they can be
    independently disabled from use as a certificate signature algorithm
    and an HMAC algorithm. The new crypto primitive psMd5Sha1_t is
    intended to replace standalone MD5 or SHA1 use outside of where
    required in TLS.
-   3DES is not deprecated, but be aware of key strength limitations vs.
    AES-128 and AES-256.


Deprecated TLS Features

-   TLS cipher suites that rely on deprecated crypto algorithms have
    also been deprecated in matrixsslConfig.h
-   TLS Compression support is now deprecated and the option removed
    from the configuration.
-   False Start support is now deprecated and the option removed from
    the configuration.


Key Strength

Key strength defines have not changed since previous releases, however
it should be noted that the default minimum RSA/DH sizes of 1024 and ECC
sizes of 192 do not meet a growing number of security standards and
larger keys should be beginning to be deployed.


Ephemeral Cipher Suites Enabled by Default

ECDHE and DHE cipher suites are now enabled by default. Be aware that
for embedded platforms, this may require significant additional CPU
load.


ECC Curve List

The supported ECC Curve list is now always given in bit-strength order.
This ensures that when negotiating EC Parameters, the strongest
available will be used.


Reordered cipher suite preferences

Clients send a priority list order of cipher suites during TLS
negotiations, and servers use a priority list of ciphers to pick a
common cipher for the connection.

MatrixSSL orders this list using the following rules, resulting in some
change to the cipher suite preference order in _cipherSuite.c_. In order
to make as secure a connection as possible, the parameters of
Authentication, Data Integrity and Data Security were taken in that
order to generate a new cipher preference list. In places where these
parameters are of equivalent strength, the faster algorithm is preferred
(although the “faster” algorithm often depends on the platform).
_Currently DHE is prioritized over ECDHE due only to performance. In
future releases, ECDHE may be the preferred key exchange mode._

The ordering of the ciphers is grouped and sub-grouped by the following:

1.  Non-deprecated
2.  Ephemeral
3.  Authentication Method (PKI > PSK > anon)
4.  Hash Strength (SHA384 > SHA256 > SHA > MD5)
5.  Cipher Strength (AES256 > AES128 > 3DES > ARC4 > SEED > IDEA > NULL)
6.  PKI Key Exchange (DHE* > ECDHE > ECDH > RSA > PSK)
7.  Cipher Mode (GCM > CBC)
8.  PKI Authentication Method (ECDSA > RSA > PSK)


memset_s()

Use the memset_s() api to zero memory regardless of compiler
optimization which might skip zeroing for memory that is not
subsequently used. For platforms without a built in implementation,
memset_s() is automatically built in core/memset_s.c


Handshake State Machine Improvements

Simplified code paths

The handshake decode state machine was split among additional files and
functions. Switch statements replace other logic to more clearly show
each case and its result. The state machine is still quite complex due
to the large number of modes and states that are supported in MatrixSSL.
Always consult support when making changes to the state machine.

Multiple state tracking

Connection state tracking has always been implemented as "expected next
state", with no security issues. However for a double check, MatrixSSL
now implements independent tracking of the last state encoded and
decoded, as well as the expected next state.

More strict extension processing

The extension parsing is more strict in what can be accepted and when.



3 FEATURES AND IMPROVEMENTS


DTLS Protocol Included

Beginning in the 3.8.2 version of MatrixSSL, the DTLS 1.0 and DTLS 1.2
protocols are included in MatrixSSL open source package.

Enable USE_DTLS in _./matrixssl/matrixsslConfig.h_ to include it in
library. Additional documentation, app examples, and test code is
included to aid in development.


Optimized Diffie-Hellman performance

Use smaller generated key sizes for a given DH prime field size per NIST
SP 800-57 Part 1. This provides up to a 9x performance gain for DH
operations, greatly increasing the speed of ephemeral ciphers using DH.


Optimized EC signature generation performance

Improved performance for finding valid ECC key pairs, especially on
larger key sizes.


OpenSSL Crypto Primitive Provider

Allows MatrixSSL to be linked against _OpenSSL_ libcrypto as a crypto
primitive provider. This allows platforms that use _OpenSSL_ as their
crypto API (such as _Cavium Octeon_) provide hardware acceleration to
MatrixSSL applications.


OpenSSL TLS API layer

Users wishing to replace _OpenSSL_ with MatrixSSL often desire a layer
that will ease the integration. MatrixSSL 3.8.2 includes an _OpenSSL_API
layer that was previously provided upon request. This layer is found in
the _./matrixssl_ directory in the _opensslApi.c_and _opensslSocket.c_
files. The _opensslApi.h_ and _opensslSocket.h_ headers define the
interface.


Reduced TLS session footprint

The size of each TLS session was reduced by 512 bytes for AES cipher
suites, and additionally by ~100 bytes for all cipher suites.


X.509 Improvements

OID parsing has been improved and provides better feedback on error.
SHA-512 signed certificates are now supported.


PKCS#12 Key Parsing

Support for longer passwords and additional private key bag.


Improved certificate callback example

The _./apps/ssl/client.c_ application now has a more robust processing
example to help integrators understand the relationship between the
incoming alert value and the individual authStatus members of the
server’s certificate chain.


Per digest control of HMAC algorithms

Each HMAC algorithm can now be specifically enabled/disabled with
USE_HMAC_(digest) defines in _cryptoConfig.h_


Default high resolution timing

POSIX platforms will have high-resolution timers active by default


Assert and Error Optimizations

USE_CORE_ASSERT and USE_CORE_ERROR can now be disabled in
_coreConfig.h_. This can reduce code size by removing the static strings
used in errors and asserts. Recommended for final deployment only.



4 BUG FIXES


64 bit little endian platforms

The STORE32L macro in _cryptolib.h_ has been fixed for little endian 64
platforms. The STORE32H macro in _cryptolib.h_ has been fixed for big
endian 64 platforms not using assembly language optimizations. Platforms
such as _MIPS64_ are now automatically detected by the build system.


X.509 KeyUsage extension

Fixed the parse to allow for BIT_STRING lengths longer than should be
expected.


X.509 date validation fix

A bug has been fixed in the validateDateRange() function in _x509.c_. In
previous versions, the time format (ASN_UTCTIME, etc..) of the notAfter
date was being set based on the notBefore field. This bug would have
caused problems for certificates that used different time formats for
the notBefore and notAfter fields.


Fixed handshake parse issue

A bug was found on the server side while parsing a specific case of
handshake messages from a client. If the cipher suite used a key
exchange mechanism of ECDHE or ECHE, and the handshake was using client
authentication, and the client was sending the CLIENT_KEY_EXCHANGE
message and CERTIFICATE_VERIFY message in a single record, the MatrixSSL
server was unable to parse that flight and would close the connection.
This is now fixed.


TLS server sending old self-signed certificate

A bug has been fixed so that if a server sends a self-signed certificate
that does not contain the AuthorityKeyIdentifier extension, the
authentication logic will detect that and not report an error to the
certificate callback. > Servers shouldn’t send self-signed certificates
in the CERTIFICATE message. Client must still always have the same
self-signed cert loaded in order to authenticate.


Fixed ECC variable encoding bugs

For Client Auth rehandshakes, the variable signature sizes of ECDSA
resulted in an issue when clients were creating the encrypted
CERTIFICATE_VERIFY message. secp224r1 curves also had an additional bug
that could cause an invalid signature in some cases due to the variable
encoding rules.


DHE_PSK compatibility

Fixed issue with DHE_PSK ciphers when a PSK_ID was not used. Previously
a handshake alert would occur.


AES-GCM with AESNI

Fixed an issue causing an invalid encoding of large data buffers with
aes-gcm on Intel platforms with AESNI.


Library configuration test

The mechanism to test that MatrixSSL applications have been compiled
using the same configuration as the MatrixSSL static libraries has been
fixed.


Windows psGetFileBuf

Parameters to CreateFileA() are now correct for opening existing files.



5 KNOWN ISSUES


-   _Microsoft Windows_ targets do not support certificate date
    validation currently. Users requiring this feature can use Windows
    APIs to get and parse the current date, using the POSIX
    implementation as a reference.
-   _Arm_ platforms linking with some versions of _OpenSSL_ libcrypto
    library may have errors in AES-CBC cipher suites due to the
    library's inability to handle in-situ encryption within the
    same block.
